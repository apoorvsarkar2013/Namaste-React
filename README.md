## const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World from React!");


### React.createElement ===> This is an object that contains the properties you want to assign to the created element. 

### Here "h1" is the HTML element we wanted to create.

### {} ===> This represents the object for the element's properties or attributes.

### "Hello World from React!" ===> The content or children of the element.


## console.log(heading) ===> This will return an Object. 

## root.render(heading) ===> This render method is converting this "heading" object to an "h1" tag
